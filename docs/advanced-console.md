### Advanced Console
We integrate Redis commands with IntelliJ as a custom language, then we can have commands and keywords auto-completion, syntax inspection, commands formatting etc.

All commands are supported in the console and you can execute as many commands as you want with one go, just like executing some kind of scripts.

We also make the result view more friendly for developers and you can also view the result as JSON, XML, plain text etc.

Select your desired Redis server and click ![terminal](/assets/images/advanced-console/terminal.png){:class="icon"} or use shortcut ```⌘ + ⇧ + F10``` on Mac and ```Ctrl + Shift + F10``` on Windows to open console:

![open console](/assets/images/advanced-console/open-console2.png)

This is how it looks like, it's simple and powerful:

**Note**: The console will be available after Redis Server mode is determined.
