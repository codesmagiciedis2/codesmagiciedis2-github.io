You're now ready to configure your Redis server. You'll be asked to provide both your Redis server host and port to add a new server,
you need to fill in the password field if your Redis server needs authentication. 
You can also label your servers with meaningful names if you have many different Redis servers to manage:

You can switch to SSH tab to set up a proxy if you need to use a proxy to connect to your Redis server:

![ssh](/assets/images/configure-server/ssh2.png){:class="screenshot"}

Use ```Test Connection``` to test your configuration before confirming your configuration to make sure everything is well configured:

### Cluster
You can use any node to configure Redis server if it is running under cluster mode, Iedis 2 takes care of everything for it at runtime.

Iedis 2 will list all master and slave nodes in case if you want to connect to it to use some functionality which is only available on a single server, for instance, [Advanced Console](advanced-console).
