### Servers Window
To configure Redis servers you need to open Redis servers window first. There are two different ways to open it, the first one is to click it on the right toolbar:

Another way is to use shortcut ```âŒ˜ + E``` on Mac and ```Alt + E``` on windows to open recent files dialog and type ```redis``` to search for ```Redis Servers``` option.
You're suggested to use the shortcut to work with IntelliJ because it's more efficient.
