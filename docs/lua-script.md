### Lua Script
Iedis 2 integrates Redis commands with Lua script to make it easier to edit Lua script by providing auto-completion, command auto-completion, parameter auto-completion, documentation etc. 
We can also run and debug Lua script directly in our IDE.

### Lua Plugin
Redis integration was built upon 'EmmyLua' plugin which is provided by [tangzx](https://github.com/EmmyLua/IntelliJ-EmmyLua). 
You need to install it before using integrated Lua editor. You can install it by following [Getting Started](/) which is the same process to install Iedis 2.
