### Select Database
You can switch between different databases if you're using a standalone Redis server.
The 0 database will be selected automatically the first time you open key explorer:

![select database](/assets/images/select-database/select-database2.png){:class="screenshot"}

**Note**: This is not available if Redis server is running under cluster mode.
